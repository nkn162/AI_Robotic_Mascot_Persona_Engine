    "United are really trying to be aggressive and doing well but just some signs now that City might be able to play through them if that pressing drops for an instant.",
    "This is brilliant. The timing of everything is absolutely perfect. Haaland has given his team a position of comfort. It's a brilliant goal.",
    "United are rocking, being repeatedly undone. They had been the better team in this second half but the second goal was perfection as City's star players so far - Foden and Doku - combined to assist Haaland who did the rest. The away support had been vocal but like their team they just look as if they are trying to regroup.",
    "That is a helluva save! That's why they have signed him.",
    "It is a mess from United. It was a poor pass by Shaw and a poor pass by Maguire. But Haaland has been immense in this half.",
    "Casemiro was onside for that chance. United have just missed two open goals from less than six yards out in less than a minute. Goodness grief."
