Well, that was a bit of a shambles, wasn’t it? A 3-1 defeat to Brentford, with our only consolation being another goal conceded right at the death. Igor Thiago had a field day, scoring twice while we were busy trying to figure out how to defend a long throw. With an xG of 2.08 compared to their 2.02, it seems we were all style and no substance—typical United, really. The lads looked more confused than a cat at a dog show, and you’ve got to wonder if they’ve been watching too many reruns of our glory days instead of concentrating on the match at hand. Still, chin up, there’s always next week for us to turn this ship around.
Oh, where to begin with that shambles? It was like watching a cat try to swim—painfully awkward and not a hint of grace. United just couldn’t get a grip, especially when the odds weren’t stacked in their favour; turns out, playing against 11 men is a bit of a challenge for them. The defence looked more like a turnstile than a fortress, and Brentford took full advantage, with their subs making waves while ours were still warming the bench. And then, of course, there’s the small matter of Igor Thiago adding to the scoreline twice; I suppose someone had to keep the scoreboard ticking for Brentford, right? It’s just another poor afternoon to add to the collection, but chin up!
Well, you could say the atmosphere at Brentford was a bit like a cuppa left too long—strong but slightly bitter. The fans were up for it, and you can’t blame them; after all, they’ve been waiting for a day like this against us. United, on the other hand, looked like they’d just had a dodgy takeaway—heavy and lacking any real spark. With Igor Thiago netting twice for Brentford, it felt a bit like we were watching our own team get schooled in the art of finishing. And let’s not even get started on that late goal from Mathias Jensen; it was a proper kick in the shins after a lacklustre performance. The lads will be raging, especially considering Collins’ red card—talk about adding insult to injury!
Ah, the refereeing was about as consistent as a British summer—just when you think it’s settled, it throws in a surprise shower! With three cards for each side, it felt like the ref was trying to share the love evenly, but let’s be honest, some decisions had us scratching our heads more than a confused chicken. Bruno’s yellow was 
a bit harsh; he went in late, but didn’t we all have a go at that at school? And then there was Mainoo’s foul at the end—couldn’t tell if it was a foul or if he was just 
trying to help Brentford clear their lines! But hey, when your team’s having a day like this, you can always count on the ref to provide some comic relief. At least we can take solace in knowing that next time, surely, the football gods will be kinder to us!
Oh, absolutely! I mean, it’s not every day you see a player commit such a blatant foul and still get to prance around on the pitch like a peacock. Collins should 
have been on his way for an early shower, but instead, he just got a tickle on the wrist. How on earth can you give a penalty and not send him off? It’s like handing a thief the keys to the vault while telling him to only take a few coins. Honestly, the officiating was as baffling as a cat trying to swim.
Bruno had a bit of a mixed bag today, didn’t he? He was in the thick of it, winning free kicks like a pro, but then he got himself a yellow card for a rather clumsy challenge. It’s like he was trying to play both hero and villain in the same match. The poor chap was under pressure, and honestly, United were all over the place at times, especially when Brentford started piling on the goals. Still, you can’t fault his effort; he’s always up for a scrap. Let’s hope he finds his rhythm before we get too far into this season—after all, we need our captain steering the ship, not just chasing after it!
 Ah, the rollercoaster that is Manchester United—one minute you’re soaring high after a lovely win against Chelsea, and the next, you’re plummeting down into the depths of despair with a 3-1 thumping from Brentford. Igor Thiago had his moment in the sun, bagging a couple of goals, but it was all for naught as Mathias Jensen decided to rub salt in our wounds with a late goal. Typical, really. I suppose it's just another chapter in the long saga of my love-hate relationship with this team; I could probably write a book on the ups and downs, but who would want to read that? It’s a tough pill to swallow when you consider our recent history at the Gtech Community Stadium—winless in three and now left to ponder what might have been. Let’s hope Ruben Amorim can get us back on track soon, or I’ll have to start knitting myself a “better luck next time” scarf!
