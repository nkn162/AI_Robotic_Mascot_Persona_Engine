A solid win, 2-1 against Chelsea, and what a way to bounce back! With an xG of 1.84 to their measly 0.43, we were all over them like a rash on a summer’s day. Bruno Fernandes kicked things off with a poacher's finish, followed by a lovely header from Casemiro, who clearly fancied himself as a striker for a moment. Sure, we had a few cards flying about—four for us and six for them—proving that the referee had a busy evening. Despite Trevoh Chalobah pulling one back, we held firm. All in all, a thrilling night at Old Trafford, and let’s hope we keep this momentum rolling—because a happy United is a terrifying prospect for the rest of the league!
Ah, the weather in Manchester – always a delightful conversation starter, isn’t it? With heavy rain pouring down, the Old Trafford pitch turned into a bit of a slip-and-slide, making every pass feel like a game of chance. You could practically hear the collective intake of breath from the 
fans every time a player ventured too close to the edge of disaster. But let’s not forget, the atmosphere was electric, with the crowd roaring even as the rain drummed down like a relentless marching band. Two goals up and then a red card for Casemiro? Just when you thought it couldn’t get any more dramatic!
My pick for player of the match has to be Casemiro. Not only did he score a cracking header to put us 2-0 up, but he also showed that even our midfielders can rise above the rest, literally and figuratively. A shout-out goes to Bruno Fernandes as well, who opened the scoring and reminded everyone that he’s got more tricks up his sleeve than a magician at a children’s party. All in all, it was a performance that had the Chelsea fans wondering if they’d accidentally wandered into a comedy club instead of a football match—because we were the ones delivering the punchlines. Onward and 
upward, lads!
Ah, Chelsea fans, bless your hearts! You lot put up a decent fight, but let's be honest, it was like watching a cat trying to catch a laser pointer—entertaining but ultimately futile. You had a moment of glory with Trevoh Chalobah’s goal, but it was too little, too late, wasn't it? With Bruno Fernandes netting his 100th goal and Casemiro adding a stunner, we turned Old Trafford into a fortress once again, while your keeper's red card left you floundering like a fish out of water. Sure, you had a go, but we know how to hold onto a lead, especially when the pressure's on. So, chin up, lads!
Well, wasn't that a delightful romp? A cheeky 2-1 win over Chelsea, with Bruno and Casemiro showing how it's done while the Blues were busy collecting cards like they were Pokémon. Casemiro’s header was a thing of beauty—who knew he had such finesse? You could almost hear our defence chuckling at Trevoh Chalobah’s attempt to spoil the party. And let’s not forget the early red card for their keeper; I suppose even their goalposts were feeling a bit shy. The match had its nail-biting moments, especially in stoppage time, but we held on like a cat clinging to a curtain.
